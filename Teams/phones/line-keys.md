# Line or speed dial keys on Microsoft Teams certified phones

This article provides you with guidance on setting up and managing line keys (or speed dial keys) on Microsoft Teams certified phones. This feature allows your users to use a phone line key to set up speed dial for their contacts and phone numbers for quick access using buttons on touch and non-touch devices. A phone line key is one of the keys used to designate individual lines on a phone. Depending on the model and manufacturer, phones typically have between 2 and 12 phone line keys. 

## Steps to use line keys to set up speed dial for non-touch devices 

To set up a line key for speed dial, follow these steps:

1. **Update the Teams phone to version 1449/1.0.94.2024101709 or later**. After updating the phone, you notice a new home screen experience on your device with a dedicated place for your line keys. To update your Teams phones, see [Update your phones remotely](remote-update-teams-phones.md).  Verify that you're running Android version 1449/1.0.94.2024101709 or later.

    You can see the versioning information in the Teams admin center or on the Teams phone.
   
    To see it in the Teams admin center:
   
   1. Sign in to the Teams admin center.
   1. Go to **Teams devices** > **Phones** > then select the phone you want to look at.
